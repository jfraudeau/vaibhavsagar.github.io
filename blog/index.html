</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>When I started this blog, I was reluctant to put a continuous integration
system like Travis-CI in charge of deployment and I settled for the approach
outlined
<a href="http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html">here</a> which
worked reasonably well. However, I recently realised that automating my
deployment would allow me to theoretically create a post using the GitHub web
interface which would automatically get turned into a new post on my blog.
This would allow me to use this blog from any web browser! In other words, I
wanted a convoluted reimplementation of half of a CMS's functionality.</p>
<p>I found a very helpful <a href="http://zonca.github.io/2013/09/automatically-build-pelican-and-publish-to-github-pages.html">blog
post</a>
that covered most of the details I needed. Let me go through the changes I
made.</p>
<p>First off, I use Python 3 wherever possible so I simplified my
<code>requirements.txt</code>:</p>
<p><script
src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/website/blob/master/requirements.txt"></script></p>
<p>My <code>.travis.yml</code> is different too (I removed unnecessary nesting to make it
shorter):</p>
<p><script
src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/website/blob/master/.travis.yml"></script></p>
<p>I installed the <code>travis</code> gem, got a GitHub token, and tried to set the token
with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>travis encrypt GH_TOKEN=LONGTOKENFROMGITHUB --add env.global
</pre></div>


<p>but it didn't recognise my repository until I went to my <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile/">Travis-CI
profile</a>, enabled GitHub access, and enabled it
to check my repository.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy.sh</code> script was almost the same (change your username):</p>
<p><script
src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/website/blob/master/deploy.sh"></script></p>
<p>and that was all the setup I had to do. I then pushed a commit and watched as
Pelican and its dependencies were downloaded, my blog posts were regenerated,
and my GitHub Pages repo was updated. Seems a bit wasteful, but it was
surprisingly easy to get working.</p>                </article>

buy some clothes from Uniqlo (as good as everyone says) and watch a movie (Edge
of Tomorrow). This is pretty unremarkable, except that I did this... in
Jakarta! I didn't think it was ...</p>
