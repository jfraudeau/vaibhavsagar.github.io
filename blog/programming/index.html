<p>In <a href="http://www.vaibhavsagar.com/blog/programming/">programming</a>. </p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>After <a href="{filename}blog-setup.md">automating my blog</a>, I decided to aim a little
higher and use Travis-CI to automate document generation from my resume. I use
<a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> to convert my source resume written
in Markdown to Github-flavoured Markdown, an HTML file for my website, and a
PDF (via LaTeX) that I've spent a ludicrous amount of time styling. I do have
all these packages configured on my home computer, but it was becoming tedious
to make changes and commit three separate files instead of just one. I was also
finding it difficult to keep the PDF version of my resume up to date with the
rest of my changes, and I thought it would be an interesting challenge to get
everything set up in a repeatable manner.</p>
<p>The versions of <code>pandoc</code> and <code>LaTeX</code> on Ubuntu 12.04 (which Travis-CI uses for
its workers) are hopelessly out of date, so my first problem was getting the
newest version of <code>pandoc</code> installed. It is available as a <code>.deb</code>
<a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases">here</a>, and Github being Github, this
information is also provided as JSON. There's this really nifty tool called
<code>jq</code> which is like <code>sed</code> for JSON so I found and used that. After having a play
with it <a href="https://jqplay.org/">here</a> I was able to construct the filter I
needed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>jq -r &#39;.assets[] | .browser_download_url | select(endswith(&quot;deb&quot;))&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>The '-r' is there so that <code>wget</code> won't choke on the output which would
otherwise be surrounded in double quotes. I was then able to install the
downloaded package without any issues. This is what my pre-install script
looked like:</p>
<p><script
src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/resume/blob/master/prepare.sh">
</script></p>
<p>I already had a <code>Makefile</code>, so converting my source to Github-flavoured
Markdown and HTML was as easy as <code>make readme</code> and <code>make html</code>:</p>
<p><script
src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/resume/blob/master/Makefile">
</script></p>
<p>I decided it would be best if the build process updated my <code>gh-pages</code> branch
instead of uploading to a different repository:</p>
<p><script
src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/resume/blob/master/.ci/update_pages.sh">
</script></p>
<p>The next challenge was actually generating my PDF and uploading it to Github
Releases. Travis CI has excellent support for deploying binaries to Releases
but using the <code>travis</code> gem to configure support makes a completely new Github
token which I thought was a bit redundant. The documentation for <code>travis
encrypt</code> is pretty comprehensive and I just encrypted my old token and used
that instead. My completed <code>.travis.yml</code> is as follows:</p>
<p><script
src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/resume/blob/master/.travis.yml">
</script></p>
<p>And if you'd like to see the process I went through to arrive at this solution,
have a look at <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/resumate">the test repo</a> I
used. The commit log is a fairly accurate representation of my thought process.
