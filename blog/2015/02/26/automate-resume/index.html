<p>After <a href="../../../../../blog/2015/02/01/blog-setup">automating my blog</a>, I decided to aim a little higher and use Travis-CI to automate document generation from my resume. I use <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> to convert my source resume written in Markdown to Github-flavoured Markdown, an HTML file for my website, and a PDF (via LaTeX) that I’ve spent a ludicrous amount of time styling. I do have all these packages configured on my home computer, but it was becoming tedious to make changes and commit three separate files instead of just one. I was also finding it difficult to keep the PDF version of my resume up to date with the rest of my changes, and I thought it would be an interesting challenge to get everything set up in a repeatable manner. One good reference is <a href="http://www.steveklabnik.com/automatically_update_github_pages_with_travis_example/">this blog post</a> by Steve Klabnik.</p>
<p>The versions of <code>pandoc</code> and <code>LaTeX</code> on Ubuntu 12.04 (which Travis-CI uses for its workers) are hopelessly out of date, so my first problem was getting the newest version of <code>pandoc</code> installed. I used <code>stack</code> to download and install this.</p>
<p>I already had a <code>Makefile</code>, so converting my source to Github-flavoured Markdown and HTML was as easy as <code>make readme</code> and <code>make html</code>:</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/resume/blob/master/Makefile">
</script>
<p>I decided it would be best if the build process updated my <code>gh-pages</code> branch instead of uploading to a different repository:</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/resume/blob/master/.ci/update_pages.sh">
</script>
<p>The next challenge was actually generating my PDF and uploading it to Github Releases. Travis CI has excellent support for deploying binaries to Releases but using the <code>travis</code> gem to configure support makes a completely new Github token which I thought was a bit redundant. The documentation for <code>travis encrypt</code> is pretty comprehensive and I just encrypted my old token and used that instead. My completed <code>.travis.yml</code> is as follows:</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/resume/blob/master/.travis.yml">
</script>
<p>And if you’d like to see the process I went through to arrive at this solution, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/resumate">the test repo</a> I used. The commit log is a fairly accurate representation of my thought process. If you’re trying something similar and you’re getting stuck, feel free to reach out and I’ll be more than happy to help.</p>
