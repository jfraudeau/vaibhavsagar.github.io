<p>When I started this blog, I was reluctant to put a continuous integration system like Travis-CI in charge of deployment because it seemed like a frivolous use of resources and so I settled for the approach outlined <a href="http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html">here</a> which worked reasonably well. As my understanding of continuous integration and the possibilities of Travis improved, I changed my mind and decided it would be a good idea to automate this process. I also realised that automating my deployment would allow me to theoretically create or update a post using the GitHub web interface which would automatically get turned into a new post on my blog. This would allow me to use this blog from any web browser! In other words, I wanted a convoluted reimplementation of half of a CMS’s functionality.</p>
<p>I found a very helpful <a href="http://zonca.github.io/2013/09/automatically-build-pelican-and-publish-to-github-pages.html">blog post</a> that covered most of the details I needed. Let me go through the changes I made.</p>
<p>First off, I use Python 3 wherever possible so I simplified my <code>requirements.txt</code>:</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/website/blob/master/requirements.txt"></script>
<p>My <code>.travis.yml</code> is different too (I removed unnecessary nesting to make it shorter):</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/website/blob/master/.travis.yml"></script>
<p>I installed the <code>travis</code> gem, got a GitHub token, and tried to set the token with</p>
<pre><code>travis encrypt GH_TOKEN=LONGTOKENFROMGITHUB --add env.global</code></pre>
<p>but it didn’t recognise my repository until I went to my <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile/">Travis-CI profile</a>, enabled GitHub access, and enabled it to check my repository.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy.sh</code> script was almost the same (change your username):</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github.com/vaibhavsagar/website/blob/master/deploy.sh"></script>
<p>and that was all the setup I had to do. I then pushed a commit and watched as Pelican and its dependencies were downloaded, my blog posts were regenerated, and my GitHub Pages repo was updated. Seems a bit wasteful, but it was surprisingly easy to get working and it performs admirably.</p>
