<p>There are many reasons to start contributing to open source:</p>
<ul>
<li>to give back to the community</li>
<li>to fix a bug in software you depend on</li>
<li>warm fuzzies</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you write software for a living, you don’t always have the time or energy to understand a new codebase well enough to make a meaningful change to it. And even if you don’t write software for a living, this still might not sound like the best of your leisure time.</p>
<p>Even if you soldier on, your pull request might linger untouched for months, like the source control equivalent of shouting into the void. Alternatively, the maintainer might be having a bad day and dismiss your pull request or expect you to do some Git voodoo to bring it up to their exacting standards. All this can turn the gift of patches into a boring and unpleasant chore.</p>
<p>To avoid this, I’ve decided to focus on easy pull requests as a precursor to engaging more fully with a project. What does this mean?</p>
<h2 id="documentation-and-typo-fixes">Documentation and typo fixes</h2>
<p>Lindsey Kuper has <a href="http://composition.al/blog/2013/05/31/one-character-patches/">a great post on these</a>. They are my favourite because I am a pedant. Witness <a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhavsagar+is%3Aclosed+README">the absurd number of README updates</a> I have to my name. They’re as easy as noticing a typo, clicking the pencil icon, and fixing it. Editing project documentation is similarly straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="linter-suggestions">Linter suggestions</h2>
<p>One day I decided to run HLint, a Haskell linter, on projects and open PRs accordingly. I had <a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhavsagar+HLint+is%3Aclosed">mixed results</a> but I think that if a project doesn’t have consistent style or a style guide this is an excellent way of opening a discussion about that.</p>
<h2 id="automated-testing">Automated testing</h2>
<p>I’m a big fan of automation, and I’d consider it one of the themes of this blog. A large number of projects don’t have good automated test suites, and even those that do sometimes let their CI setup rot over time. If this is the case, setting up Travis or Circle CI is a low-effort (if occasionally high-frustration) way of vastly improving a project. If information about how to test a specific project isn’t readily available, this is also a great opportunity for a README update (see above).</p>
<p>In all three cases, if you don’t get a quick response, or at least a positive one, I think it’s a good sign that this project is not a good fit and you’ll have learned this without investing much effort.</p>
<p>For a while I felt like these weren’t ‘real’ contributions, where ‘real’ meant writing code to add features or fix bugs, but then I realised that these approaches focus on essential, if unglamorous, aspects of being a software engineer. Writing correctly-spelled and accurate documentation, having consistent style (preferably enforced by a tool to prevent endless bikeshedding), and automatically testing your changes are important! Focusing on these practices has made me a better programmer.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve given you a few ideas about contributing to open source and why you might want to. Let me know if you have any questions!</p>
