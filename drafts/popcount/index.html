<p><em>This is a pseudo-transcript of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLFqLfz2Fmc">a presentation I did at !!Con 2019</a>.</em></p>
<p>Most CPU architectures in use today have an instruction called <code>popcount</code>, short for “population count”. Here’s what it does: it counts the number of set bits in a machine word. For example (assuming 8-bit words for simplicity), <code>popcount(00100110)</code> is <code>3</code> and <code>popcount(01100000)</code> is <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, like I was, if there’s more to this instruction, but that’s all it does! This doesn’t seem very useful, right?</p>
<p>I thought this might be a recent addition for some hyperspecialised use case, but it has in fact been present in CPU architectures since at least 1961:</p>
<ul>
<li>1961: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7030_Stretch">IBM Stretch</a></li>
<li>1964: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6000_series">CDC 6000</a></li>
<li>1975: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">Cray-1</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Advanced_SIMD_(NEON)">ARM NEON</a></li>
<li>2007: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_10h">AMD K10</a></li>
<li>2008: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture)">Intel Nehalem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s going on?</p>
<h4 id="the-nsa-instruction">The NSA Instruction</h4>
<p><code>popcount</code> is also known as “The NSA Instruction”, and a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.arch/UXEi7G6WHuU/Z2z7fC7Xhr8J">very entertaining thread on <code>comp.arch</code></a> discusses its uses inside and outside cryptography. It is rumoured that it was originally added to CPU instructions at the behest of the NSA. As <a href="http://cryptome.org/jya/sadd.htm">this archived email thread</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was almost a tradition that one of the first of any new faster CDC machine was delivered to a “good customer” - picked up at the factory by an anonymous truck, and never heard from again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes for a great story, but what were they using it for?</p>
<p>One measure of information content is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">Hamming weight</a>, which is the number of symbols in a string that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet. For a binary string, this is exactly <code>popcount</code>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=38521">As explained here</a>, the NSA wanted to do cryptanalysis on intercepted messages, and since the CDC 6000 had 60-bit words, one word was enough to store most alphabets they were interested in. They were able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Split a message into lines</li>
<li>Set a bit for each unique character they encountered per line</li>
<li>Use <code>popcount</code> to count the distinct characters</li>
<li>Use the count as a hash for further cryptanalysis</li>
</ol>
<p>Curiously, <code>popcount</code> seems to have disappeared from instruction sets between the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s, so there has to be more to it than cryptographic applications to explain its return. What else can it be used for?</p>
<h4 id="error-correction">Error Correction</h4>
<p>Related to the concept of Hamming weight is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a>, which is the number of differing positions between two strings of identical length. For two binary strings <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, this is just the <code>popcount</code> of them XORed together. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode default"><code class="sourceCode default"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">00100110</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">01100000 ^</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">--------</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4">01000110</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" title="6">popcount(01000110) = 3</a></code></pre></div>
<p>For telecommunications applications, this helps us calculate the signal distance, where a known word is sent over the wire and the number of flipped bits are counted to provide an estimate of the error introduced by transmission.</p>
<p>We can then design an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance#Error_detection_and_error_correction">error-correcting code</a> accordingly, e.g. if we want to be robust against up to 2 flipped bits, our code words need to differ in Hamming distance by at least 5.</p>
