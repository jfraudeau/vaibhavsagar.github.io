<p><em>This blog post is essentially a transcript of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oo8wIi2qBE">a 10-minute talk I gave at !!Con</a>, the slides for which are available <a href="https://vaibhavsagar.com/presentations/typed-holes/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Let’s talk about typed holes. What’s a typed hole? A definition I like is <em>“a placeholder for an expression with a known type and an unknown value”</em>.</p>
<p>Why are typed holes useful? Because they allow the language to help us write programs! To demonstrate, let’s look at some code in Python, a language that lacks this feature.</p>
<p>Suppose I want to write a function that takes another function and a list and applies the function to each element of that list. A first stab might look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="bu">map</span>(f, ls): <span class="cf">return</span> []</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This is obviously wrong: this function ignores its arguments and gives us an empty list each time. This is no good, but what’s worse is that Python will accept this definition without complaint. It doesn’t seem to know (or care).</p>
<p>Let’s try again. I hear the way to do things with lists in Python is to use a list comprehension, so I make sure to use one of those this time:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="bu">map</span>(f, ls): [f(e) <span class="cf">for</span> e <span class="kw">in</span> ls]</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" data-line-number="2">...</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> plusOne <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> i: i <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="bu">map</span>(plusOne, [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="va">None</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>But this definition is still wrong, because I forgot to put a <code>return</code> statement in! Again, Python will happily accept this.</p>
<p>I’m getting a bit frustrated at this point, so I look at how <code>map</code> is actually implemented. It uses a generator comprehension instead of a list comprehension, which makes it more general somehow, so I make sure to use that, and I remember to put a <code>return</code> statement in this time:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="bu">map</span>(f, ls): <span class="cf">return</span> (f(e) <span class="cf">for</span> e <span class="kw">in</span> ls)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">...</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="bu">map</span>(plusOne, [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4"><span class="op">&lt;</span>generator <span class="bu">object</span> <span class="bu">map</span>.<span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="bu">locals</span><span class="op">&gt;</span>.<span class="op">&lt;</span>genexpr<span class="op">&gt;</span> at <span class="bn">0x7ffb92103ca8</span><span class="op">&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>And now instead of giving me something useful, this function gives me an address in memory, which seems especially pointless.</p>
<p>I give up. This example seems contrived, but over the course of my relationship with Python, which is more than a decade long now, I’ve seen the same dynamic play out embarrassingly many times. How do I write programs that work? Surely this is a simple question with a straightforward answer.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most common response I get when I ask this question is to write tests. That sounds reasonable, so let’s do that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="bu">map</span>(f, ls):</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" data-line-number="2">...     <span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Where are your tests now?&quot;</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" data-line-number="3">...     <span class="cf">return</span> [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>]</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" data-line-number="4">...</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" data-line-number="5"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">map</span>(plusOne, [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>]) <span class="op">==</span> [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>]</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-6" data-line-number="6">Where are your tests now?</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-7" data-line-number="7"><span class="va">True</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay, my test passes, so everything must be good, right?</p>
<p>I contend that tests are necessary, but not sufficient. They are problematic for at least two reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They are only as good as the specification they imply for how a program should behave. If that specification is incomplete or wrong, no amount of tests will guarantee software that works.</li>
<li>The language doesn’t understand tests, by which I mean that it’s extremely difficult to automatically go from a failing test to the part of the code where the error lives. The programmer has to do the legwork of tracking down the bug based on essentially one bit of information in many cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, tests aren’t the only specification of how a program should behave. Types can also serve as specifications, and they have the advantage that they are extremely well integrated into the language in a way tests usually are not.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? Let’s look at Haskell. Haskell is statically typed, which means it expects to know the types of all the expressions in your program at compile time. This is nothing special though, lots of other languages also claim to be statically typed. What is special about Haskell though is that it has type inference, which means that you don’t have to annotate expressions with their types most of the time because the compiler can figure it out. If you put these two features together, you get typed holes!</p>
<p>Let’s try to write that same program in Haskell:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"></code></pre></div>
